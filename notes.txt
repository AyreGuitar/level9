0xA1 <variable1>
       1A00 is referenced at 7349 + 2 * (A1 & 1F)
       variable2 = 1A00 + 2* value of <variable1>
       It is set to 24 a LOT
       however when looking at itemst have state it also gets set 

       e.g. var 87 = 0x2 (from 0x1e16) when you do an inv  (hourglass)
            var 87 = 0x2 (from 0x1e1b) when you do an inv (matchbox)


0x500 is where the items are stored and their location

0xA1 - 
       sets a VARIABLE (always 24?) to the value of 1E00-1E9B 
       Initialise lise from memory
0xA2 - Sets a VARIABLE (always 24?) to the value of a list area 0x5C) oo 0x59b
       sets 0x5c9 - 0x59b on every move
       on entering room 0x5a1 is set to 0x3 (unwound?)
       when you wind the clock 0x5a1 is set to 0x2 (wound?)
0xE2 - change location of item
       stored in 0x500+


e.g. (must be able to generate this)

0x550 - 0x59f objects correlate to messages 0x50 - 0x9f

0x566 - fine hourglass
0x56b - matchbox
0x571 - masai spear
0x57a - candlelook

To make all objects appear in the clock:

    for x in range(80,159):
        vm_listarea[x]=3


value of item is it's location




When you get an item the list value is set to 0xFF
and then to the locatiom
inventory is e2ninv

EXITS....


On a command it checks to see if you can go that way e.g. N 

       Location n start position is always 2 bytes past the nth byte with the 8th bit set
       If the current byte does NOT have bit 8 set then check the byte+2 (repeat until 8th bit not set)
       8th bit is last byte pair for current location?

       Direction
              Variable 1 is the current location
              Variable 2 (cmd/obj) is the direction to check and held in 0x10
              Variable 3 is always 0x00
              Variable 4 is the current location 

              If bit 5 set and bits 1-4 == code that was looked up for direction
                     if next byte = from location


              If ok, 
                     variable3 is set to the bits 5-7 of the direction byte that matched e.g. 7
                     variable4 is set to the to location (byte after the direction that matched) e.g. 2

              7335+direction code is used to lookup the inverse direction 
              So South is mapped to North (south has a code of 0x4 so 7339 = 01 below)
              7335   00 04 06 07 01 08 02 03 05 0A 09 0C 0B FF FF 0F

              Then looks up the inverse direction to see if you can arrive at this location by going that way
              (I can go South if I can go North to this location)

       Look seems to set cmdobj to 0x1
When displaying a location it checks each direction to see if you can go that way in the following order
       Variable 1 is the current location
       Variable 2 (cmd/obj) is the direction to check and held in 0x10

location exits
